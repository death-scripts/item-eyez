    "summary": "ItemEyez ItemEyez is a WPF application for organizing items in rooms and containers. The project targets .NET 8 and uses SQL Server Express for data storage. Building Restore NuGet packages and build the application in Release mode: dotnet build item-eyez.sln -c Release Compile the WiX installer using the WiX Toolset (v4 is recommended). Run from the repository root: candle installer/Product.wxs -o ItemEyez.wixobj light ItemEyez.wixobj -o ItemEyez.msi candle installer/Bundle.wxs -o Bundle.wixobj light Bundle.wixobj -o ItemEyezInstaller.exe These commands are wrapped in installer/build-installer.sh which builds the application and creates the installer in one step: ./installer/build-installer.sh The resulting ItemEyezInstaller.exe will install .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 and SQL Server Express if they are not present, and then install or upgrade ItemEyez. Installer Behavior Detects Microsoft .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0. If missing, it will download and install it. Detects a SQL Server Express instance named SQLEXPRESS. If missing, SQL Server Express is installed silently. Supports upgrades when a previous version of ItemEyez is already installed."
